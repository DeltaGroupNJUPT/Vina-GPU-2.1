# DATASETS

The dataset used in expriments are from SELLECK and DrugBank.

## SELLECK

This dataset was provided by our collaborators and contains 5,148 SMILES data, stored in this directory as `SELLECK.csv`.

## DrugBank

DrugBank is a comprehensive, freely accessible database containing information on drugs and drug targets. We only used SMILES from DrugBank. You can gain access to this data by registering an account on the [DrugBank](https://go.drugbank.com/releases/latest#full) website.The small molecule SMILES used in our virtual screening experiments are stored in the `DrugBank.csv` file in this directory.

## Active Data

The active molecule SMILES used in our virtual screening experiments were from [ChEMBL](https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/downloads).We used activity data from Chembl on the three targets RIPK1, RIPK3, and AmpC Î²-lactamases to conduct virtual screening. The activity data used for each target is stored in csv format in a same-named folder in this directory.
